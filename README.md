# BlocJams

BlocJams is a Javascript based music player application. All of the image assets were made by Bloc (see below for offical acknowledgment), but I am responsible for coding and testing the music player functionality. 

There are two versions on my GitHub. This version started out with only DOM scripting, but then I refactored it to use jQuery. 

This particular application does not have a way to import and save music to a data base - the provided music serves as a way to test functionality. BlocJams uses the Buzz! library as a lightweight song management solution. 

One of the greatest challenges in this project was the music player bar. The song seek functionality and filling the seek bar to match the progress in the song were especially fantastic learning experiences.
